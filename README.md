## Pending Additions/Updates

Add support for the new "architecture" flag. This means adding "386" or "amd64" as appropriate. And it means we need to add "arm64" boxes to the pipeline.  

## Upcoming Additions

Oct 23rd, 2023 / FreeBSD 14.0  

\* Repo updated.
\*\* Beta/pre-prerelease added.  

## Pending Tasks
  
<sup><sub>_We would welcome community help (as a pull request) with any of the following tasks._</sub></sup>  
Generate docker variants for the Ubuntu/Debian/Alpine configurations  
Incorporate the upload/delete/release scripts into the robox.sh script as functions.  
Add vagrant user password randomization logic to the bundled Vagrantfiles.  
Improve the unit box validation/check script with SSH command tests/checks.
Start building ARM variants for some virtual machines/boxes.  
 ^-- WE NEED A HARDWARE DONATION TO MAKE ARM64 IMAGES  
 **THIS SHOULD, WE HOPE, IN THE WORKS --^**  
  
## Operating System Requests

The following variants of existing builds have been requested, and will be added at a future date, when time allows (or someone submits a pull request).
  
[Fedora Rawhide](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide)  
[OpenSUSE Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed)  
  
This operating system has been requested, but at present doesn't apppear to have sufficient interest. If that changes, it could be easily added by adapting the existing Debian/Ubuntu configurations.  

[Pop\!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)  
  
The following operating systems have been requested by a member of the Robox community, but require a volunteer to generate a configuration, before they can be incorporated into the workflow.

[Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/get-haiku/)  
[Minix](https://www.minix3.org/)  
[Parrot](https://www.parrotsec.org/)  
[SmartOS](https://www.joyent.com/smartos)

## Operating System Candidates

The following operating systems are potential candidates. They may be added in the future. 

Manjaro  
Mint  
OpenSolaris  
Slackware  

MacOS  
Darwin  
  
ReactOS  
Windows  

Tails  
Kali

## Building a Box

To build a Robox locally, run the following:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lavabit/robox && cd robox
./robox.sh box generic-BOX-PROVIDER-ARCH
```

You will to replace the BOX, PROVIDER and ARCH placeholders in the example above.  
  
Replace `BOX` with one of the these values:  `[alma8|alma9|alpine35|alpine36|alpine37|alpine38|alpine39|alpine310|alpine311|alpine312|alpine313|alpine314|alpine315|alpine316|alpine317|arch|centos6|centos7|centos8|centos8s|centos9s|debian8|debian9|debian10|debian11|devuan1|devuan2|devuan3|devuan4|dragonflybsd5|dragonflybsd6|fedora25|fedora26|fedora27|fedora28|fedora29|fedora30|fedora31|fedora32|fedora33|fedora34|fedora35|fedora36|fedora37|freebsd11|freebsd12|freebsd13|gentoo|hardenedbsd11|hardenedbsd12|hardenedbsd13|netbsd8|netbsd9|openbsd6|openbsd7|opensuse15|opensuse42|oracle7|oracle8|oracle8|rhel6|rhel7|rhel8|rocky8|rocky9|ubuntu1604|ubuntu1610|ubuntu1704|ubuntu1710|ubuntu1804|ubuntu1810|ubuntu1904|ubuntu1910|ubuntu2004|ubuntu2010|ubuntu2104|ubuntu2110|ubuntu2204|ubuntu2210|ubuntu2304]`
  
Replace `PROVIDER` with one of these values: `[docker|hyperv|libvirt|parallels|virtualbox|vmware]`

And replace `ARCH` with one of these values: `[x32|x64|a32|a64|p32|p64|r32|r64|m32|m64]`
  
A configuration for all of the distros is available for every provider, EXCEPT Docker. At present we have only adapted a subset of the configurations to build Docker/Podman images.  

The above presumes you already have [`packer`](https://www.packer.io/) and the hypervisor for the targeted provider installed. The `res/providers/providers.sh` script may provide guidance on the steps required to setup a Linux build host for VMWare/Virtualbox/Docker/libvirt. Please note that this scripts was written for RHEL/CentOS 7. You will then need to adapt the package names and CLI commands to your environment.  
  
## VirtualBox Disks

Enabling the discard/nonrotational options with our VirtualBox configs, appears to improve performance, but only on build robots equipped with SSDs or NVMe drives, and then only if the virtual machine is configured with VDI virtual disks. This combination allows guests to utilize discard/unmap/trim. However, if a virtual machine is deployed onto traditional magnetic hard disks with discard/nonrotational enabled, performance will drop significantly ( 1/50th of normal in some cases ). 

Furthermore, while Packer appears to use VDI disk image files, when the virtual machine is exported and converted into a Vagrant box, the disk gets converted into the VMDK format. The discard/nonrotational options are preserved, and the result is that when the base box is deployed, it results in a virtual machine with the discard/nonrotational options enabled with an unsupported VMDK virtual disk.

As a result, we are currently not using the following options in our Packer config files. 
```
"hard_drive_discard": true,
"hard_drive_nonrotational" : true,
```
A handful of relevant messages from VirtualBox when a Vagrant box is deployed with this issue.

The performance degradation leads to write timeouts, and the logs become filled with messages like the following.
