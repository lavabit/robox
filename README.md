The templates in this repo require a current version of packer, (1.3.4+) and in some cases, make use of features which haven't been officially merged and/or released yet. Use the res/providers/packer.sh script to build an appropriately patched packer binary.

## Pending Tasks

Generate docker variants for the Ubuntu/Debian/Alpine configurations  
Add upload/delete/release functions to robox.sh  
Add vagrant user password randomization logic to the bundled Vagrantfiles  
Add init based test, and SSH command test to the box test and check script  

## Pending Additions

Submit a pull request with your favorite distro.
